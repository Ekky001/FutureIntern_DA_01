# Iris Species Visualization ðŸŒ¸

## Overview

This project explores the famous **Iris dataset** through comprehensive data visualization techniques. By analyzing patterns and distributions of the dataset, we aim to uncover insights about the relationships between the features and species of Iris flowers.

---

## Features

- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values and ensuring data consistency.
- **Data Visualization**:
  - Histograms for individual feature distributions.
  - Correlation matrix to explore relationships between features.
  - Pair plots to visualize feature relationships by species.
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Visualizing insights dynamically using Plotly/Dash.

---

## Tech Stack

- **Languages**: Python
- **Libraries**: 
  - Data Processing: `pandas`, `numpy`
  - Visualization: `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `plotly`
  - Dashboard: `dash`, `dash-bootstrap-components`

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/iris-visualization.git
   cd iris-visualization
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate   # On Windows: env\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

---

## Usage

1. **Data Visualization**:
   - Generate visualizations for the Iris dataset.
   - Run `visualizations.py` to produce histograms, pair plots, and the correlation matrix.

2. **Interactive Dashboard**:
   - Launch the interactive dashboard:
     ```bash
     python dashboard.py
     ```

## Key Insights

- **Feature Distributions**:
  Sepal length, petal length, and other features exhibit distinct patterns for each Iris species.
- **Correlation**:
  Strong correlations exist between petal length and width, helping differentiate species effectively.
- **Species Separation**:
  Visualization techniques highlight the separability of species like Iris-setosa from the others.

---

## Future Work

- Expand visualizations to include 3D plots for more insights.
- Build predictive models using insights from the dataset.
- Enhance the dashboard with additional interactive features.
